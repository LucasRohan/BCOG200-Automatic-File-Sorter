### Final Project


### Brief 3-5 sentence description of planned Project

###     My computer files are a mess because I usually dump them into the same directory each time as sorting them manually often takes way too long. To solve this, I want to create an automatic file sorter. One that can scan a directory and sort each file into pre-made or new sub-folders for each type of file (image, video, or document). This program will include the ability to remove duplicate files with permission of the user. A log of all actions must also be created and kept in a separate subfolder to track system actions.


### Functions
###     A - Scan directory, create file list.
###     B - Create sub-folders in directory, sort file list. Sub-folders include duplicate/removal list.
###     C - Prompt user and show duplicate / removal list.
###     D - Track each file movement and create log of what file is moved where.
