Tests:
    - Test for the full file list after scanning the directory that confirms it does not skip files or return files with incorrect paths.
    - Test for each file type. Confirms if a document, image, or video is determined as the correct type of file so that they can be sorted correctly.
    - Tests if duplicate files can actually be detected. Tests the hash of the same file twice, if it returns the same value, it is confirmed a duplicate.
